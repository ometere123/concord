# Treasury Rulebook Example

This example demonstrates the difference between semantic conflict detection and deterministic precedence.

## Create rulebook

```text
name: Treasury Constitution
purpose: Rules governing treasury withdrawals, emergency authority, approvals, and execution constraints for a protocol treasury.
strict_mode: true
```

## Rule 1

```text
A treasury withdrawal must not execute when fewer than three approvals are present.
priority: 100
```

Expected result: `ACTIVE`.

## Rule 2

```text
Withdrawals above $10,000 require three approvals before execution.
priority: 100
```

Expected semantic relation with Rule 1: `COMPATIBLE` or `SPECIALIZES` depending on exact normalization. Expected result: `ACTIVE` if validators agree it is jointly satisfiable.

## Rule 3

```text
During an active exploit the security council may execute a withdrawal without three approvals.
priority: 100
```

Expected relation with Rule 1: `CONFLICT` in the emergency-withdrawal overlap.

Because priorities are equal, deterministic resolution is `UNRESOLVED`. In strict mode Rule 3 becomes `BLOCKED`.

## Resolve without semantic reinterpretation

Governance can explicitly change the blocked Rule 3 priority:

```text
set_blocked_rule_priority(rule_3, 200)
```

The stored conflict edge is recomputed deterministically as `RIGHT_PREVAILS`.

Then:

```text
activate_blocked_rule(rule_3)
```

No LLM is asked to reinterpret Rule 3. The semantic graph is reused.

## Amendment

To change Rule 1 from three approvals to four approvals, do not edit Rule 1. Submit a new rule:

```text
A treasury withdrawal must not execute when fewer than four approvals are present.
supersedes_rule_id: rule_1
```

If the relation is a plausible replacement and the node has no unresolved blockers, Concord activates it and marks Rule 1 `SUPERSEDED` atomically, preserving historical canon.
