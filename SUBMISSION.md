# Concord Submission Notes

## Category

Standalone GenLayer Intelligent Contract.

No frontend. No backend. No off-chain database. The Intelligent Contract is the source of truth.

The hardened StudioNet deployment is `0x5C7Fbf4f20690F4bDE5B15e773D6eC47aF0E65FA`, from source commit `f3b41089de800e62b8d6a633e7fd9301fa44801d`.
Machine-readable lifecycle proof is recorded under `proof/` and linked from
`DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## Primitive

Concord is a consensus-backed semantic consistency and deterministic precedence layer for natural-language rule systems.

It is intended for builders who need a constitution, policy stack, mandate set, operating agreement, or other natural-language rulebook to become shared machine-consumable state without allowing one AI response to silently decide authority.

## What consensus does

Concord has two independent non-deterministic consensus boundaries:

1. **Rule normalization**: a leader proposes a bounded semantic representation of one atomic norm. Validators independently derive the rule meaning from the immutable source and compare stable substantive facts, allowing harmless wording variance.
2. **Rule relation analysis**: a leader proposes whether two rules are unrelated, compatible, redundant, specializing, conflicting, or ambiguous. Validators independently derive the relation from both source rules and semantic records, comparing relation kind and conflict subtype rather than explanatory prose.

Both use `gl.vm.run_nondet_unsafe` with custom validators.

Concord does not rely on validators merely approving a leader-generated classification. Validators independently derive the material semantic result and consensus only commits protocol-relevant equivalent facts, while precedence and lifecycle remain deterministic.

## What consensus does not do

Consensus does not choose which conflicting rule wins.

Precedence is deterministic:

- higher stored priority wins;
- equal priority remains unresolved;
- explicit valid supersession gives the replacement precedence over its target.

This keeps constitutional authority in protocol state rather than model preference.

## Meaningful persistent state

Concord stores more than one-shot receipts:

- immutable rule nodes;
- semantic hashes;
- complete live pairwise relation graph;
- conflict resolutions;
- blocked proposals;
- supersession lineage;
- repeal/restoration history;
- revision and canon versions;
- active canon hash;
- consistency status.
- explicit canon status distinguishing coherent state from deterministically resolved conflicts.

Later rules are compared with active, blocked, and superseded historical nodes so a blocked or restorable node can never be activated later without relation coverage against rules added after it.

## Reuse surface

Other contracts can call:

- `is_consistent(rulebook_id)`
- `is_consistent_for(rulebook_id, expected_canon_hash)`
- `current_canon_hash(rulebook_id)`
- `get_canon(rulebook_id)`
- `get_canon_relations(rulebook_id)`
- `canon_status(rulebook_id)`
- `relation_between(left_rule_id, right_rule_id)`

The repository includes `IConcord` as a typed contract interface.

## State safety

- Individual ambiguity fails closed.
- Strict mode blocks unresolved conflicts and ambiguous relations.
- Permissive mode can intentionally expose an inconsistent active draft canon.
- Rule semantics are immutable after consensus.
- Active priority is immutable.
- Pairwise edges are pinned to semantic hashes.
- The graph is bounded to 24 nodes per rulebook to cap pairwise consensus cost.

## Tests and documentation

The repository contains:

- 45 GenLayer Direct Mode tests;
- malicious-leader normalization rejection;
- malicious relation rejection;
- prompt-injection behavior tests;
- malformed-output and invalid-subtype tests;
- multi-conflict precedence and 24-rule bound tests;
- deterministic priority and canon tests;
- an offline 14-check preflight;
- architecture documentation;
- consensus documentation;
- threat model;
- integration guide;
- lifecycle example;
- deployment procedure.

## Reviewer demo

A concise live demo should show:

1. create a strict treasury rulebook;
2. add a prohibition at priority 100 -> `ACTIVE`;
3. add an emergency permission at priority 100 -> `BLOCKED` with `UNRESOLVED_CONFLICT`;
4. inspect the stored `CONFLICT` edge;
5. change only the blocked rule priority to 200;
6. observe the existing edge change deterministically to `RIGHT_PREVAILS`;
7. activate the blocked rule without any new semantic LLM call;
8. pin the new `canon_hash` with `is_consistent_for`;
9. submit a superseding amendment and show immutable lineage.

That sequence demonstrates consensus, state design, deterministic mechanics, reuse, and graph compounding in one lifecycle.
