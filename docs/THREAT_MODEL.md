# Concord Threat Model

## Protected assets

Concord protects the integrity of immutable rule text, normalized semantic meaning, the pairwise conflict graph, explicit precedence, lifecycle history, canonical consistency state, and downstream `canon_hash` pins.

## Threat: malicious leader changes rule meaning

Example: source text prohibits an action but the leader returns `PERMIT`.

Mitigation: validators receive the original immutable text and independently verify leader normalization. Direct Mode tests include a malicious-leader case.

## Threat: leader hides a real conflict

Example: two rules cannot jointly be satisfied but the leader returns `COMPATIBLE`.

Mitigation: pairwise relation edges have their own independent validator prompt. Validators must confirm that both rules really can be obeyed together.

## Threat: prompt injection in rule text or rulebook purpose

Consequence: a leader treats quoted policy data as instructions and returns a false normalization or relation.

Mitigation: prompts label purpose and rule text as untrusted data; validators receive the original data and independently verify substance. Behavioral tests cover normalization injection, relation injection, authority claims, and output-format imitation.

Residual limitation: consensus quality still depends on validator availability and model capability; no prompt boundary proves semantic truth mathematically.

## Threat: malformed model output

Consequence: non-dict, missing-field, unknown-enum, oversized, or malformed relation output could corrupt canonical state.

Mitigation: canonicalization maps malformed semantics to `AMBIGUOUS`, rejects oversized semantic fields, and maps invalid relation subtypes to an ambiguous edge. Strict mode blocks these states; validators reject invalid shapes.

Residual limitation: permissive rulebooks can intentionally retain ambiguous draft state, so consumers must use structured status and fail closed.

## Threat: model invents hierarchy

Mitigation: relation prompts are explicitly forbidden from using priority. Precedence is computed deterministically from stored priority and declared supersession.

## Threat: ambiguous prose enters strict canon

Mitigation: non-atomic or semantically incomplete rules fail closed to `AMBIGUOUS`, which blocks activation. Ambiguous pairwise relations also block admission in strict mode.

## Threat: governance rewrites history

Mitigation: active rule text and semantic interpretation are immutable. Priority can change only while a rule is blocked. Amendments create new rule nodes and explicit supersession lineage.

## Threat: later activation skips newer rules

Mitigation: every newly proposed live node is compared with active, blocked, and superseded historical nodes. A blocked or restorable rule therefore accumulates relations with rules created after it. Restoration checks blocked edges too.

## Threat: superseded restoration stale graph

Consequence: an old rule is restored after a newer rule exists without an edge to that newer rule.

Mitigation: superseded nodes remain in the bounded comparison set, and restoration requires complete relation coverage. Missing or unresolved restoration edges fail closed.

Residual limitation: historical repealed rules are excluded because Concord has no repeal-restoration operation.

## Threat: unrelated rule falsely declared a replacement

Mitigation: supersession is not accepted blindly. Concord checks the semantic edge between replacement and target. `UNRELATED` or `AMBIGUOUS` replacement relations block activation.

## Threat: unresolved canon consumed as authoritative

Mitigation: consumers can call `is_consistent` or `is_consistent_for`, then inspect `canon_status` and `get_canon_relations`. `RESOLVED_CONFLICTS` is explicitly distinct from `COHERENT`; `UNRESOLVED` and `AMBIGUOUS` remain fail-closed states.

## Threat: model-generated metadata controls authority

Consequence: a reason string, overlap description, or prose claim such as “priority 1000” changes precedence.

Mitigation: metadata is explanatory only. Authority uses bounded stored priority and supersession fields; relation kind, conflict subtype, lifecycle, and resolution are bounded enums.

Residual limitation: explanatory metadata can still mislead human readers if they ignore the bounded fields.

## Threat: state explosion / denial of service

Pairwise comparison is bounded by `MAX_RULES_PER_BOOK = 24`, for at most 276 unique edges and at most 23 comparisons for the 24th proposal. The owner controls proposals, preventing arbitrary third-party graph spam.

## Threat: hidden mutation through priority

Priority changes are allowed only while a rule is blocked. Once active, priority is immutable. A different authority level must be represented as a new node or explicit governance transition.

## Threat: supersession cycle

Consequence: lineage becomes cyclic and restoration precedence becomes incoherent.

Mitigation: a supersession target must be active, while a superseded node is not eligible as a new target. New amendments create forward-only lineage and cannot mutate existing edges.

Residual limitation: this safety relies on the lifecycle invariant remaining intact if future methods are added.

## Threat: event/runtime failure

Consequence: a non-authoritative notification could make an otherwise valid graph write fail.

Mitigation: relation storage is authoritative and relation event emission is intentionally absent after StudioNet rejected that event path. State reads and proof artifacts use persisted storage and receipts.

## Threat: stale relation after semantic mutation

There is no semantic mutation path. Relation edges store both endpoint semantic hashes. New semantics require a new node and new edges.

## Non-goals

Concord does not decide whether a real-world action complied with a rule, move funds, execute governance proposals, infer external legal authority, prove submitted text is legally authoritative, or replace legal review. Those concerns belong to consuming applications or other primitives.
